# REFLECTION AND TAKEAWAYS
1. A good eLearning authoring tool is important

The biggest disadvantage of Easygenerator is that it collects limited data, which prevent us from further conducting quantitative analysis and analyzing users’ learning outcomes. It's easier to produce more engaging content if the authoring tool collects more data like time-per-page, click rate, etc. 

2. Multimedia is a top principle to engage learners
